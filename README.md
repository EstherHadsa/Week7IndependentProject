# Week7IndependentProject
This contains the week 7 IP which includes Financial Inclusion in East Africa and Hypothesis Testing for Autolib dataset

# PART 1
**Financial_Inclusion_In_East_Africa**

This project aims to figure out which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account


**Project Description**

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

**Metric of Success**

Our analysis will be a success if we shall be able to provide insights to the state of financial inclusion and the key demographs that influence this.

# Part 2
**Hypothesis-Testing-Autolib-dataset**


An autolib electric car sharing service company wants to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the Autolib dataset

**Hypothesis**

*Null Hypothesis:*


Is the average number of blue cars taken during the weekend for area 75001 equal to that of area code 93260 at 0.05 significance level?

H0: µ1 = µ2 at α = 0.05

*Alternate Hypothesis:*


Is the average number of blue cars taken during the weekend for area 75001 not equal to that of area code 93260 at 0.05 significance level?

Ha: µ1 ≠ µ2 at α = 0.05
